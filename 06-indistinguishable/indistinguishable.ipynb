    "Let us look more closely at some of the parameters in this input file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The total number of MD time steps to be performed is defined in `<total_steps>..</total_steps>`. In our case, we choose 1000000 steps.\n",
    "* The number of imaginary time slices (beads) is defined in `<initialize nbeads=\"..\">`. In our case, we choose 32 beads.\n",
    "* The temperature is defined in `<temperature units=\"kelvin\">..</temperature>`. In our case we, choose a system temperature of 17.4 kelvin.\n",
    "* The simulation cell geometry is defined inside `<cell> [x, 0, 0, 0, y, 0, 0, 0, z] </cell>` (where the zeros indicate an orthogonal basis) which accepts an array used to initialize the cell vector matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seed number, which is used to generate the initial state of the random number generator, is defined in `<prng><seed>..</seed></prng>`. It must be an integer, and it is used to randomly generate the initial velocities of the beads. Note that when `thermal` is set as the mode in `velocities`, it tells i-PI to generate velocities from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution according to the temperature provided in `<velocities>..</velocities>` (which in this case coincides with the system temperature).\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting positions of the beads are defined inside the `<positions></positions>` tag, which is nested within the `<initialize nbeads=\"..\">` tag. Pay special attention to its structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "`<positions mode=\"manual\" bead=\"0\"> [x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ...] </positions>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial coordinates are listed inside square brackets (this is a one-dimensional list, i.e., an array). The coordinates themselves consist of ordered triplets of numbers. Each triplet corresponds to the x, y and z components of the position vector. The total number of triplets must be equal to the total number of quantum particles that we wish to simulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the parameter `mode=\"manual\"` you inform i-PI that the coordinates will be specified in the input file itself (as opposed to loading them from elsewhere). In addition, the `bead` parameter specifies the index of the bead for which we set the initial positions. Unless specified otherwise, the bead positions are initialized to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics that correspond to the selected ensemble are specified inside the `<dynamics mode=\"nvt\">..</dynamics>`. The timestep, as well as the properties of the thermostat (e.g., the timescale of the friction coefficient, `<tau units='femtosecond'>..</tau>`) are defined within this tag. Note that `mode='pile_l'` attaches a white noise Langevin thermostat to the normal mode representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the output of the simulation is specified in the `<output prefix=\"data\">..</output>` tag. In particular, the list of the desired physical observables is defined in the `<properties stride=\"100\"> [ .. ] </properties>`. We chose to extract the following energy estimators:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The virial kinetic energy estimator (`virial_fq`). *Note*: i-PI calculates `virial_fq` by taking the dot product of the forces and coordinates. Therefore, in order to obtain the correct energy, one must take the negative of the printed value.\n",
    "* The potential energy estimator (`potential`).\n",
    "* The centroid-virial kinetic energy estimator (`kinetic_cv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in order to obtain particle coordinates, we write `<trajectory stride=\"100\" filename=\"pos\" cell_units=\"angstrom\">..</trajectory>`. In both cases, `stride=\"100\"` means that the output is printed once in every 100 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding the external harmonic trap\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, i-PI does not perform force calculations itself. Instead, it relies on an external engine for this task. Once an external engine is properly configured, i-PI establishes communication with the engine through a socket connection to generate the required molecular dynamics trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note about the socket address**: If you choose to use the same socket name for all input files, as is the case for this tutorial, it is important to ensure that i-PI removes the socket once the simulation is completed. While this is typically done automatically, there are instances where the socket may not be removed, such as when the user abruptly interrupts the simulation. In such cases, if you attempt to run a simulation with the same socket address again, you will encounter an `Address already in use` error. The error message will contain the following information at the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error opening unix socket. Check if a file /tmp/ipi_localhost exists, and remove it if unused.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this issue, you can follow the suggested solution by removing the file using the command `rm -f /tmp/ipi_localhost`. Alternatively, you have the option to change the socket address to a different and unused address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, i-PI comes with some basic Fortran hard-coded potentials that can be accessed through the `i-pi-driver` file. You should have this file if you properly compiled the code in the “drivers” directory (e.g., using the UNIX utility `make`). We will make use of this empirical potential client code to perform our PIMD simulations. In particular, we will use the `harm3D` potential which, as the name suggests, corresponds to the 3D harmonic potential. Most potentials require additional arguments (such as the spring constant, in the case of the harmonic oscillator). Some additional \"built-in\" potentials include the double well potential, Lennard-Jones potential, Morse potential, and Zundel potential. For a comprehensive list of all the potentials, please refer to the `drivers/f90/driver.f90` file."

Specifically, we aim to perform a path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulation involving three bosons, utilizing the same parameters as those employed in the previously discussed scenario with distinguishable particles.
